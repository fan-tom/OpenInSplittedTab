# Open in splitted tab
AppCode plugin (also works in other Jetbrain-IDEs like IntelliJ, PhpStorm and so on) to open the declaration/implementation of the current selected symbol within a vertically splitted tab. If there already is an splitted tab (either vertically or horizontally), it will use this. Else it will open a new one. The intention was to rebuild this functionality of the "assistant-editor" in Xcode.
